# Personal Portifolio


In this project I replicate one of Figma's template to create my own portifolio by using flexbox.

In this project I have used linter for HTML and CSS, to make sure there are no linter errors on the code. This portifolio website contains four sections:
1. header
2. home
3. Work
4. about-me
5. Contact-me
